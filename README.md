# PictureProcessingApp

We created a simple Photo Editor App in Android studio. It has two options for your image source that will be filtered, a scroll down menu for choosing the filter to be applied, a button for applying the filter as well as four buttons for rotation and horizontal/vertical flipping. The scroll down menu has eight options:
1) None Selected
2) Pixel Art Filter
3) Blur Filter
4) Invert Filter
5) Greyscale Filter
6) Brightness/Contrast Filter
7) Colour Filter
8) Blend Filter

When selecting one of the last three options a new Activity is loaded. 

For Brightness/Contrast Filter two seekbars were implemented. The first one is for increasing/decreasing the brightness and the second one is for increasing/decreasing the contrast.

For Colour Filter the new activity has eight coloured buttons to choose from and a Clear Button.

For Blend Filter the new activity chooses a second photo which is to be blended with the first one chosen in the Main Activity.

All the three additional activities have a Go Back button and all four activity have a Save Button.
